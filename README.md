'data' contains the necessary csv files to run the code, but not the predictions from the neural networks or the training data as the files were too large.

'notebooks' is a collection of python notebooks used.

'plots' contains some but not most of the plots.

'snellius-scripts' contains the scripts i made to run at snellius for higher grid dimensions (i ran 100x100 on a notebook on snellius so only 250 and 500 are in this folder).
